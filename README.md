## Introduction

- hdf files can be a pain to inspect especially since the delivered tools such as hdf view are usually some GUI based interfaces that require you to have a display manager running on your computer
- in the area of HPC you quite often deal with large hdf files and you just need to check some small meta data without copying the entire dataset to your machine
- h5textual is a tool that allows you to do this from the command line

## Installation

```bash
pip install h5textual
```
